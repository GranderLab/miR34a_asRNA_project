#Introduction
An antisense transcript to the miR34a HG was detected using the UCSC genome browser.

#Methods
The USCS genome browser was utilized for the bioinformatic evaluation of antisense transcription utilizing the Human EST and ENCODE RNAseq tracks.

#Results

A schematic picture of the miR34a locus from UCSC genome browser including miR34a HG and mature miR34a and LINC01759. H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data from ENCODE indicating the promoter region and conservation over the locus is also shown.

#Conclusion
GENCODE annotation supports the presence of a transcript orinionating in the antisense orientation from the miR34a gene.
