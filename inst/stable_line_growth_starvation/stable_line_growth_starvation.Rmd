#### _Introduction_

As p53 is a well-known regulator of senescence, growth, and apoptosis and has been shown to specifically important under conditions of cellular stress, such as starvation. Therefore, we investigated whether overexpression of miR34a AS affects growth rate under normal and starvation conditions by measuring changes in confluency over time.

<br></br>

#### _Methods_

<br></br>

_Cell culture and confluency quantification_

10^4 PC3 cells, either miR34a asRNA overexpressing or WT, were seeded in 96 well plates. After attachment (3-4h) media was replaced with either RPMI (Gibco, life technology) (supplemented with 2mM L-glutamine, 50ug/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin and 10% Fetal Calf Serum) or HBSS. Cells were incubated in Spark Multimode Microplate reader for 48 hours at 37Â°C with 5% CO2 in a humidity chamber. Confluency was measured every hour. 

<br></br>

_Analysis_

Three technical triplicates were included in each experiment and these were independantly normalized for each condition to the 0 time point afterwhich the mean was calculated. The 95% confidence interval was then calculated based on the three independant experiments which were preformed.

#### _Results_

  Confluency / pull(data, Confluency)[bool]

#### _Conclusions_

miR34a asRNA overexpression causes a minor decrease in cell growth under normal conditions (RPMI) although under conditions of cellular stress through starvation, this effect is increased dramatically.
