#Introduction
We wished to examine expression in different tissue types and, therefore, utilized a panel of common cell lines to detect miR34a asRNA expression, as well as, miR34a HG. We included both p53+/+ and p53-/- cell lines in the cell line panel due to the fact that miR34a is a known downstream target of p53. 

#Methods
Cells were cultured with the appropriate growth medium and seeded at a desity between 50-75% confluency. The following day, RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and subsequently treated with DNase (Ambion Turbo DNA-free, Life Technologies). 500ng RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using MuMLV (Life Technologies) and a 1:1 mix of oligo(dT) and random nanomers. PCR was run for 35 or 38 or 16 cycles for miR34a asRNA, miR34a HG, and beta-actin, respectivley, with 58ËšC annealing temperature. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel.

Semi-quantitative PCR data from the screening of a panel of cell lines. 
* Indicates that, although the cell line is p53wt, other mechanisms are present which inhibit p53 function. 

#Conclusions
We were able to detect co-expression of both miR34a HG and miR34a AS in a variety of cell lines, including HCT116 human colon cancer cells and 293T human embryonic kidney cells. A correlation was observed between both miR34a HG and miR34a asRNA expression and p53 status, with p53+/+ cell lines tending to have higher expression of both transcripts.
