#Introduction
We desired to access the polyadenylation status of the miR34a asRNA transcript.

#Methods
All cell lines were cultured at 5% CO2 and 37° C with HEK293T cells cultured in DMEM high glucose (Hyclone). All growth mediums were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin and 50 μg/ml of penicillin. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and subsequently treated with DNase (Ambion Turbo DNA-free, Life Technologies). 500ng RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using MuMLV (Life Technologies) and a 1:1 mix of oligo(dT) and random nanomers.

Polyadenylation status of the spliced and unspliced variants of miR34a asRNA in HEK293t cells. 

#Conslusion
miR34a asRNA appears to be polyadenylated.
