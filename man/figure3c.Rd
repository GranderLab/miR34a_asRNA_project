\description{
10^4 PC3 cells, either miR34a asRNA overexpressing or mock, were seeded in
96 well plates. After attachment (3-4h) media was replaced with either RPMI
(Gibco, life technology) (supplemented with 2mM L-glutamine, 50ug/ml
Penicillin-Streptomycin and 10% Fetal Calf Serum) or HBSS. Cells were
incubated in Spark Multimode Microplate reader for 48 hours at 37Â°C with 5%
CO2 in a humidity chamber. Confluency was measured every hour. Three
technical triplicates were included in each experiment and these were
independantly normalized for each condition to the 0 time point afterwhich
the mean was calculated. The 95% confidence interval was then calculated
based on the three independant experiments which were preformed.
